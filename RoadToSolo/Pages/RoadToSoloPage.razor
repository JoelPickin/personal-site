            It has been my dream to work for myself for as long as I can remember.
            I've been inspired by so many amazing creators who have turned their skills into money on the web.
            I'm finally at the point in my life where I can realistically give this a go.

            This page holds a variety of metrics that I will update as I go along my journey.
