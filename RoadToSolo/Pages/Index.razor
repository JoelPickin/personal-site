                <p>
                    I’m Joel. I’m a self-taught software developer from the UK.

                    I left work <span class="dynamic-content">@daysLeftAtWork</span> days ago to become a solo founder and build cool stuff on the internet,
                    with the overall goal of finding financial freedom.
                </p>

            </div>
            <div class="about-project">
                <p>
                    My projects have made <span class="dynamic-content">@revenue</span> and I have  <span class="dynamic-content">@runway</span> days of savings currently put away.

                    I went from self-taught to senior in 4 years but the employed lifestyle has never been my goal.

                    Watch me <span style="text-decoration: line-through; text-decoration-thickness: 2px;">succeed</span> fail through this site and my personal diary in the <a href="/roadtosolo">Road To Solo Newsletter</a>.
